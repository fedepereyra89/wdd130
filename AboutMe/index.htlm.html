    <h2>Federico Pereyra</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! I'm so happy to be here in this class with you. I'm married to my beautiful wife, estefy, 
    we're expecting our first baby. I served my mission in Peru Lima-Sur in 2011. My wife was also a missionary.
    I'm 32 years old. I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Fan of Messi, and fan of Racing Club de Avellaneda. La Academia!!! 
    Sorry, I got a little excited!!</p>
    <p>I currently work in an insurance company for 5 years.</p>
    I have enjoyed Pathway connect and look forward to learning a lot this semester with you. I like to program, 
    I had never done it in my life and it is something that I love to learn and do the last semester. My idea is to make web pages, support or improve them.
    Something like this is my idea, we'll see as time goes by what I end up doing!</p>
    I've been reading a bit about you and I see that we are going to be a beautiful group!
    The best for this semester for you! 

    </p>Sincerely,</p>

    Fede</p>
