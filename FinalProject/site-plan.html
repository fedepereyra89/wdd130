      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hi, we are Arkadia Deco'. We love woodworking surely as much as you do. 
        We have beautiful models of mates and materos set. 
        We have mates made from palo santo, oak, carob, caldén, quebracho, and pumpkin. 
        Do you like our models but would you like to give them a personal touch? 
        We can give you that so your gift is even more special. 
        We can't compete with other places or brands, sure, but our small business 
        is big enough to give your gifts that special touch. Whether for family, friends, or you!
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My ideal is that it reaches everyone. Woodworking is beautiful for what they represent. 
        In our case, we give it a personalized touch to make it more pleasing to the buyer. 
        Whenever we choose a gift for ourselves or for someone else, we do it based on the design 
        and what that design conveys, if we can personalize it better. 
        We are a small business but we have a variety of products that may be liked by consumers 
        and we do personalized work, that is a guarantee that your gift will be perfect.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Products</h3> <!-- pag2-->
      <p>Here at Arkadia Deco', we take our work seriously to offer you the best product. Here are some of them. First, we cure the Mate, so it is ready for use. Usually this is something you would do but why do we do it? Because in that way we make sure that the wood does not crack and ruin the work we do on the outside. After painting it with one of our designs or the one you choose, we give it a few coats of lacquer to ensure that the paint lasts much longer.

      <img src="images/mate_1.png" alt="image for page">
      <p>1. Fill a thermos with hot water.
      <p>So that the temperature of your mate is at its right point, make sure that it is neither lukewarm nor boiling. The advisable thing is that it is between 80 and 90º C. The elderly will tell you to try with a burner and kettle fire; the most modern ones that use electricity.</p>
      <img src="images/mate_2.png" alt="image for page">
      <p>2. Throw yerba into the mate and shake.</p>
      <p>The slogan is once again strict and requires that the mate not capsize with yerba or fail. By eye (no gauges) fill up to three quarters of the container. Then, cover the mouth of the mate with one hand, invert it and then shake it a couple of times to remove the dust. Do not forget after blowing the palm of your hand so as not to stain the first thing you grab./p>
      <img src="images/mate_3.png" alt="image for page">
      <P>3. Lie down, form a hole and pour warm water.</P>
      <p>Now lay the yerba on one of the walls of the mate to form a hole in the opposite wall, and then gently pour warm water. It is essential that it does not boil so as not to burn the yerba and, therefore, lose its taste. Let stand a few seconds.</p>
      <img src="images/mate_4.png" alt="image for page">
      <p>4. Insert the bulb.</p>
      <P>If this works out for you, you are now in a position to proclaim yourself a porteño. A practical recommendation: cover the upper hole of the bulb with a finger and place it in the hole you created earlier. The great risk of this step (and for which we would fail the exam) is that the mate is covered.</P>
      <img src="images/mate_5.png" alt="image for page">
      <P>5. "Cebar" Prime or pour the water.</P>
      <p>Now with the aforementioned ideal temperature, we begin to prime the mate. Little water should be placed in turn and always in the same place (next to the light bulb is the best alternative). Important: the primer is always the same. If someone dares to take the thermos and prime themselves... they deserve to be expelled from the round.</p>
      <img src="images/mate_6.png" alt="image for page">
      <P>6. Share a moment.</P>
      <p>The round begins and it is essential to respect the turns. Nothing to skip or return favors outside the mate. Some fat biscuits in the center of the round and, as we would say for these payments, that's you! Much affection and little twisting, zero anguish and even more so to celebrate that precise and exact moment in which we share some good dunks.</p>
