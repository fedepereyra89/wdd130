            <img class="mate-1" src="images/mate_1.png" alt="mate 1">
            <p>1. Fill a thermos with hot water.
            <p>So that the temperature of your mate is at its right point, make sure that it is neither lukewarm nor boiling. The advisable thing is that it is between 80 and 90º C. The elderly will tell you to try with a burner and kettle fire; the most modern ones that use electricity.</p>  
            <img class="mate-2" src="images/mate_2.png" alt="mate 2">
            <p>2. Throw yerba into the mate and shake.</p>
            <p>The slogan is once again strict and requires that the mate not capsize with yerba or fail. By eye (no gauges) fill up to three quarters of the container. Then, cover the mouth of the mate with one hand, invert it and then shake it a couple of times to remove the dust. Do not forget after blowing the palm of your hand so as not to stain the first thing you grab.</p>
            <img class="mate-3" src="images/mate_3.png" alt="mate 3">
            <P>3. Lie down, form a hole and pour warm water.</P>
            <p>Now lay the yerba on one of the walls of the mate to form a hole in the opposite wall, and then gently pour warm water. It is essential that it does not boil so as not to burn the yerba and, therefore, lose its taste. Let stand a few seconds.</p>
            <img src="images/mate_4.png" alt="image for page">
            <p>4. Insert the bulb.</p>
            <P>If this works out for you, you are now in a position to proclaim yourself a porteño. A practical recommendation: cover the upper hole of the bulb with a finger and place it in the hole you created earlier. The great risk of this step (and for which we would fail the exam) is that the mate is covered.</P>
            <img class="mate-5" src="images/mate_5.png" alt="mate 5">
            <P>5. "Cebar" Prime or pour the water.</P>
            <p>Now with the aforementioned ideal temperature, we begin to prime the mate. Little water should be placed in turn and always in the same place (next to the light bulb is the best alternative). Important: the primer is always the same. If someone dares to take the thermos and prime themselves... they deserve to be expelled from the round.</p>
            <img class="mate-6" src="images/mate_6.png" alt="mate 6">
            <P>6. Share a moment.</P>
            <p>The round begins and it is essential to respect the turns. Nothing to skip or return favors outside the mate. Some fat biscuits in the center of the round and, as we would say for these payments, that's you! Much affection and little twisting, zero anguish and even more so to celebrate that precise and exact moment in which we share some good dunks.</p>
